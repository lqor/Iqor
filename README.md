## Hey, Igor here ðŸ‘‹

I am a Salesforce Developer turned into founder. Currently, I am building a platoform to teach Salesforce Development for beginners in Apex. I stream the hwole process on YouTube and Twitch, so that you can see literally everything.

I stream coding, marketing and all I can show. Welcome!

## Why a new platform? ðŸ˜¬
I run Apex cohort-based courses, but it's a pain to scale them. To help me with the work, I want to develop a platform that will check all the code autoamtically. 

## Oh no, really? ðŸ¥¸
I know what you think - "Omg, another coding platform??". No, it's the first ever platform for Salesforce. There are literally only two that do approximetly the same. But none of them in a strucutured, professional way. 

## What do you do for living? ðŸ« 
I run mentoring coding business. Well "business". Basically me sitting down with people and teach them how to code. Also run sometimes cohort-based courses.
