Hey, Igor here ðŸ‘‹

I am a Salesforce Developer turned into founder. Currently, I am building a platoform to teach Salesforce Development for beginners in Apex. I stream the hwole process on YouTube and Twitch, so that you can see literally everything.

I stream coding, marketing and all I can show. Welcome!

### Why a new platform?
I run Apex cohort-based courses, but it's a pain to scale them. To help me with the work, I want to develop a platform that will check all the code autoamtically. I know what you think - "Omg, another coding platform??". No, it's the first ever platform for Salesforce. There are literally only two that do approximetly the same. But none of them in a strucutured, professional way. 

P.S. I am also full-time founder since September 2023 and teach programming in my courses.
